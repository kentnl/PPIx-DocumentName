PPIx::DocumentName

This module contains a few utilities for extracting a "name" out of an
arbitrary Perl file.

Typically, this is the "module" name, in the form:

  package Foo

However, it also supports extraction of an override statement in the
form:

  # PODNAME: OverrideName::Goes::Here

Which may be more applicable for documents that lack a "package"
statement, or the "package" statement may be "wrong", but they still
need the document parsed under the guise of having a name ( for purposes
such as POD )
