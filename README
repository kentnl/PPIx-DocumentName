PPIx::DocumentName

This module contains a few utilities for extracting a "name" out of an
arbitrary Perl file.

Typically, this is the "module" name, in the form:

  package Foo

However, it also supports extraction of an override statement in the
form:

  # PODNAME:

  Usage:

The recommended approach is simply:

  use PPIx::DocumentName;

  # Get a PPI Document Somehow
  return PPIx::DocumentName->extract( $ppi_document );

However, if you require multiple invocations of this, that could quickly
become tiresome.

  use PPIx::DocumentName qw( extract_docname );

  return extract_docname( $ppi_document );
